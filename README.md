# Starbucks-UI-Re-Design
So here's a refreshing, thirsty & hungry re-design to the Starbucks mobile app. Adding more emotions, color & life to the app. Representing the face of
premium drinks & food viewing & ordering interactions. The current UI lacks power and punch as compared to the in-store experience. This new re-design 
fulfills just that. Right from the start "Home Page" we see beautiful colors, linear gradients, principles of Glass Morphism & beautiful animations to make 
the user more thirsty & hungry. The assignment was just to re-design the UI so no changes to the UX & Userflow were done.
